			<h2>I Love Colorado</h2>
			<p>At least in the summer. I love the mountains and the outdoors. I could spend my life hiking and camping and getting lost in the woods. I believe it's my calling to be a mountain man when I grow up. I took this picture at the top of Pikes Peak this summer!</p>

			<h2>Outdoor Craziness</h2>
			<p>Here's some pictures from my last time in Colorado this summer. I went white water rafting for the first time in 15 years and I was initially nervous. It couldn't have been more exciting. Actually it could have been. Next time I'm looking for crazier rapids. These were cool but mostly cake.</p>

			<h2>I Used To Write Music</h2>
		  <p>Here's a selection of songs I wrote. They are all in some state of unfinished-ness. I stopped a few years back to pursue school and a career. Perhaps one day I'll revisit it as a hobby.</p>
